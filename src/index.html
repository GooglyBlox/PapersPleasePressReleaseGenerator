MINISTRY OF SCHEDULED CELEBRATION
PARADIZNA, ARSTOTZKA

&quot;PAPERS, PLEASE&quot; 10TH ANNIVERSARY

The Ministry of Scheduled Celebration congratulates Arstotzka and the Ministry of Admission for ten successful years of service at Grestin Border Checkpoint. A nation is defined by its borders, and the checkpoint in West Grestin represents an unparalleled success in presenting Arstotzka at its best.

Several ministries have contributed significant resources to effect the celebration of this momentous occasion.

---- The Ministry of Discounts &amp; Flash Sales has reduced the price of border checkpoint simulator &quot;Papers, Please&quot; software on all platforms, to $1.99, until end-of-day August 11.

---- The Ministry of Fabric has produced several garments, appropriate for off-duty inspectors or ministry staff.

---- The Ministry of Melody has collected several popular songs to amuse inspectors, now available on partnered music broadcasters.

---- The Ministry of Pocket Electronics has developed a cutting-edge simulated hand-held training tool, &quot;LCD Please&quot;, to sharpen inspectors' wits.

---- The Ministry of Giving has secured a donation of $100,000 to support the International Rescue Committee in their mission to help those affected by conflict and disaster.

Finally, the Ministry of Gratitude Assignment would like to extend great thanks to all 5 million inspectors that have dutifully served at Grestin Border Checkpoint over the last 10 years. Your unwavering eye and deft skill are testaments to the vast resourcefulness of the Arstotzkan spirit."></textarea>
